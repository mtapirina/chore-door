# Chore Door - Codecademy Project

In this project, we will use our knowledge of JavaScript and the DOM to complete Chore Door, a
single-page interactive game built with JavaScript. 

Play a few rounds and see how you fare against the ChoreBot. Your goal is to open all of the doors without running into ChoreBot. If you manage to avoid ChoreBot until you open the last door, you win!
